<h1>CSF Statewide Digital Intern Application</h1>
<p>CSF's Digital Intern Program (DIP) is a new initiative for the 2013-14 academic year. <br> <br>

Open to all CSF students, DIP is a remote internship program designed to give CSF students an opportunity to work directly with the statewide organization on innovative projects. The primary target of these projects will be to build a stronger and more collaborative network among CSF's 1000+ chapters. We will be delegating responsibilities based on your unique background and skills, but in general we are looking for adaptable individuals capable of maintaining digital relationships and fulfilling commitments. An appetite for building new technical skills is also a plus! <br> <br>

While DIP is an unpaid internship, those selected will be granted a unique opportunity to develop leadership skills in a statewide context while building technical skills that will provide benefit in college and beyond. In addition, our initial DIP class will be featured on our new statewide website when it is completed this summer! <br> <br>

Applications are due on Friday, May 24, 2013, and interviews will be conducted via Skype shortly thereafter. If you have any questions about the application please contact Keith Knapp, CSF Director of Technology, at keith@csfcjsf.org. <br> <br>
